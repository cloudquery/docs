# Views

CloudQuery policies support creating SQL Views, that can be accessed in all the queries (`checks`) in your policies.
This allows us to reuse code between different SQL queries.

For this tutorial, We'll write a policy that finds all AWS EC2 instances that have unrestricted 
outbound access to the internet (or more specifically, all EC2 instances that have a security group that allows
unrestricted access to the internet). This example is inspired by our 
[public egress policy](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws/tree/main/public_egress) that we released
in response to the [log4j vulnerability](https://www.govcert.ch/blog/zero-day-exploit-targeting-popular-java-library-log4j).
You can read more about the log4j vulnerability and the `public_egress` poicy in [this blog post](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/aws-log4j-and-finding-unrestricted-outbound-access).
Using a *view* in this policy allows us to reduce the query complexity (this is especially useful if multiple
queries use the same view).

A quick reminder that a policy is a directory with a `policy.hcl` file at its root.
Let's create such a directory now:

```bash
mkdir my_ec2_public_egress_policy
```

And in it, let's create a `policy.hcl` file:

```hcl title="my_ec2_public_egress_policy/policy.hcl"
policy "my-ec2-public-egress-policy" {
  title = "Find EC2 instances with outbound access to the internet"

  configuration {
    provider "aws" {
      version = ">= 0.10.0"
    }
  }

  view "aws_security_group_egress_rules" {
    title = "AWS Security Group Egress Rules"

    query = <<ENDOFQUERY
    WITH sg_rules_ports AS (
        SELECT
            sg.account_id,
            sg.region,
            sg.group_name,
            sg.arn,
            sg.id,
            p.from_port,
            p.to_port,
            p.ip_protocol,
            p.cq_id AS permission_id
        FROM aws_ec2_security_groups sg
            LEFT JOIN
                aws_ec2_security_group_ip_permissions p ON
                    sg.cq_id = p.security_group_cq_id
        WHERE p.permission_type = 'egress'
    )
    SELECT sgs.*,
        r.cidr AS ip
    FROM sg_rules_ports sgs
        LEFT JOIN
            aws_ec2_security_group_ip_permission_ip_ranges r ON
                sgs.permission_id = r.security_group_ip_permission_cq_id

    ENDOFQUERY
  }

  check "ec2-instances-with-unrestricted-outbound-access" {
    type = "manual"
    title = "Find all ec2 instances that have unrestricted access to the internet via a security group"
    query = <<ENDOFQUERY
    -- Find all AWS instances that have a security group that allows unrestricted egress
    SELECT id,
        region,
        account_id,
        vpc_id
    FROM aws_ec2_instances
    WHERE cq_id IN
    -- 	Find all instances that have egress rule that allows access to all ip addresses
    (SELECT instance_cq_id
        FROM aws_ec2_instance_security_groups
            JOIN aws_security_group_egress_rules ON group_id = id
        WHERE (ip = '0.0.0.0/0' OR ip = '::/0'))
    ENDOFQUERY
  }
}
```

We can then run this policy with

```bash
cloudquery policy run ./my_ec2_public_egress_policy
```

And we will get a list of all EC2 instances that allow unrestricted outbound access to the internet.

We will not go over everything that is happening in these queries, but some points to note are:
- After a `view` is defined, it can be used in any `check` query in the policy.
- A `view` is defined with a standard `SELECT` query, and other queries can then `SELECT` from this view
  exactly as if it were a standard SQL table.
- The name of the `view` is what appears right after the `view` word, and before the open-curly-bracket.
  This name will be used by the other queries to access the view. In our example, this is `aws_security_group_egress_rules`.
- The queries are using the [heredoc](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/strings#heredoc-strings) format for multiline strings.

## Referencing a View in a Separate File

Just like with the queries in `check` blocks, we can reference a file instead of inlining the SQL query directly
in the `view`'s `query` field.

For our example, we can have a separate `aws_security_group_egress_rules_view.sql` file, and reference it from
`policy.hcl`:

```hcl title="my_ec2_public_egress_policy/policy.hcl"
policy "my-ec2-public-egress-policy" { 
    ...

    view "aws_security_group_egress_rules" {
        title = "AWS Security Group Egress Rules"
        query = file("./aws_security_group_egress_rules_view.sql")
    }

    ...
}
```

and in the `aws_security_group_egress_rules_view.sql` file:

```sql title="my_ec2_public_egress_policy/aws_security_group_egress_rules_view.sql"
WITH sg_rules_ports AS (
    SELECT
        sg.account_id,
        sg.region,
        sg.group_name,
        sg.arn,
        sg.id,
        p.from_port,
        p.to_port,
        p.ip_protocol,
        p.cq_id AS permission_id
    FROM aws_ec2_security_groups sg
        LEFT JOIN
            aws_ec2_security_group_ip_permissions p ON
                sg.cq_id = p.security_group_cq_id
    WHERE p.permission_type = 'egress'
)
SELECT sgs.*,
    r.cidr AS ip
FROM sg_rules_ports sgs
    LEFT JOIN
        aws_ec2_security_group_ip_permission_ip_ranges r ON
            sgs.permission_id = r.security_group_ip_permission_cq_id
```

:::tip
It is recommended to use relative paths ("./some-path", "../some-path", etc.) to reference files for queries and views.
Using absolute-paths tends to couple the path to your specific machine, and cause errors down the road.
