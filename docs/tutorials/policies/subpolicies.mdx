# Subpolicies

Let's continue with our example, and imagine we now have a policy with a lot of checks we'd like to run against
our cloud deployment 
(All example queries are taken from our [AWS Foundational Securtiy Best Practices policy](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws/tree/main/foundational_security)):

```hcl title="my_second_policy/policy.hcl"
policy "my_second_policy" {
  title = "My Second CloudQuery Policy"

  configuration {
    provider "aws" {
      version = ">= 0.10.0"
    }
  }

  check "old-stopped-ec2-instances" {
    title = "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period"
    query = "SELECT account_id, region, id FROM aws_ec2_instances WHERE state_name = 'stopped' AND NOW() - state_transition_reason_time > INTERVAL '30' DAY"
    expect_output = false
  }

  check "ec2-instances-with-public-ip-addresses" {
	title = "EC2 instances shouldn't have a public IP address"
	query = "SELECT account_id, region, id FROM aws_ec2_instances WHERE public_ip_address IS NOT NULL"
	expect_output = false
  }

  check "efs-encrypts-data-at-rest" {
	title = "EFS should be configured to encrypt file data at rest using AWS KMS"
	query = "SELECT account_id, arn FROM aws_efs_filesystems WHERE encrypted IS DISTINCT FROM TRUE OR kms_key_id IS NULL"
	expect_output = false
  }

  check "efs-volumes-are-in-backup-plans" {
	title = "EFS volumes should be in backup plans"
	query = "SELECT account_id, arn FROM aws_efs_filesystems WHERE backup_policy_status IS DISTINCT FROM 'ENABLED'"
	expect_output = false
  }
}
```

As the policy expands, we might want to split it into multiple **subpolicies** - for instance, 
an `ec2` subpolicy, and an `efs` subpolicy (this is similar to the structure of our [foundational_security policy](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws/tree/main/foundational_security)).
The subpolicies can then be run separately.

Our `policy.hcl` will now become:

```hcl title="my_second_policy/policy.hcl"
policy "my_second_policy" {
    title = "My Second CloudQuery Policy"

    configuration {
        provider "aws" {
            version = ">= 0.10.0"
        }
    }

    policy "ec2" {
        source = file("./ec2_subpolicy.hcl")
    }

    policy "efs" {
        source = file("./efs_subpolicy.hcl")
    }
}
```

We will create two more files in our `my_sceond_policy` directory: `ec2_subpolicy.hcl` and `efs_subpolicy.hcl`:

```hcl title="my_second_policy/ec2_subpolicy.hcl"
policy "ec2" {
    title = "EC2 subpolicy"

    configuration {
        provider "aws" {
            version = ">= 0.10.0"
        }
    }

    check "old-stopped-ec2-instances" {
        title = "Stopped EC2 instances should be removed after a specified time period"
        query = "SELECT account_id, region, id FROM aws_ec2_instances WHERE state_name = 'stopped' AND NOW() - state_transition_reason_time > INTERVAL '30' DAY"
        expect_output = false
    }

    check "ec2-instances-with-public-ip-addresses" {
        title = "EC2 instances shouldn't have a public IP address"
        query = "SELECT account_id, region, id FROM aws_ec2_instances WHERE public_ip_address IS NOT NULL"
        expect_output = false
    }
}
```

```hcl title="my_second_policy/efs_subpolicy.hcl"
policy "efs"{
    title = "EFS subpolicy"

    configuration {
        provider "aws" {
            version = ">= 0.10.0"
        }
    }

    check "efs-encrypts-data-at-rest" {
        title = "EFS should be configured to encrypt file data at rest using AWS KMS"
        query = "SELECT account_id, arn FROM aws_efs_filesystems WHERE encrypted IS DISTINCT FROM TRUE OR kms_key_id IS NULL"
        expect_output = false
    }

    check "efs-volumes-are-in-backup-plans" {
        title = "EFS volumes should be in backup plans"
        query = "SELECT account_id, arn FROM aws_efs_filesystems WHERE backup_policy_status IS DISTINCT FROM 'ENABLED'"
        expect_output = false
    }
}
```

We can then run our sub-policies separately with the following cmmands (`./my_second_policy` is the path to the `my_second_policy_directory`):
```bash
cloudquery policy run ./my_second_policy//ec2

cloudquery policy run ./my_second_policy//efs
```

We can also run a single query separately with:

```bash
cloudquery policy run ./my_second_policy//ec2/old-stopped-ec2-instances
```

## What is "//"? How is it different from "/" and where should it go?

The `//` indicator when running subpolicies or subqueries is an idiosyncrasy of the way the `cloudquery` CLI works.
It separates the "path to the policy" from the "path to the subpolicy (in the policy)".

So, in our above example, if the policy I'd like to run is in `./my_second_policy`, and I would like
to run the `old-stopped-ec2-instances` query in the `ec2` subpolicy, I would use:

```bash
cloudquery policy run ./my_second_policy//ec2/old-stopped-ec2-instances
```

It is worth mentioning here that the `cloudquery` CLI also supports running policies from 
[our official github](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies). The `//` separator serves the same function 
described above - separating the "path to the policy" from the "path inside the policy". In case of running
policies from github, it helps the `cloudquery` CLI to know which repo to clone.

So, to run the `foundational_security` **subpolicy** in the the `aws` **policy**, we run.

```bash
cloudquery policy run aws//foundational_security
```

:::tip Summary
When calling `cloudquery policy run`, the `//` separator separates the "path to the root policy" from
the "path to the subpolicy/subquery". It should always appear **after the root poicy**.
