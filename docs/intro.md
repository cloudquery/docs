# Welcome to CloudQuery

CloudQuery is the [open-source](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) cloud asset inventory powered by SQL.

CloudQuery extracts, transforms, and loads your cloud assets into normalized PostgreSQL tables enabling you to assess, audit, and monitor the configurations of your cloud assets.

## Key Features & Use Cases

### Cloud Asset Inventory powered by SQL. Backed by PosgreSQL.

Create cloud asset inventory in your own self-hosted PostgreSQL database.

One place to easily see an aggregated view, monitor, analyze, and understand all these assets across clouds, accounts and services.

Visualization, analyze, monitor and alert with your current tools and worksflows such as Grafana.

### Search & Visibility

Give developers, SREs, DevOps and security engineers a streamlined way to gain visibility and perform wide range of tasks. Such as security analytics, fleet management auditing and governance. 


[CloudQuery Providers](https://hub.cloudquery.io) gives you the ability to gain visibility across accounts, different cloud providers, and SaaS applications.

### Policy as Code

Turn your security and compliance tasks to data problems and solve them with the best tools and practices in DataOps.

Your security and compliance workflows and rules can now be solved using SQL and as data problem. 

You can write your security and compliance rules using SQL as the query language and HCL as the engine. Just like you use IaC to build, change, and version your infrastructure, you can use CloudQuery Policies to monitor, alert, and version your cloud infrastructure security and compliance rules.


### IaC (Infrastructure-as-code) Drift Detection

CloudQuery extensible architecture implements takes advantage of the core cloud asset inventory and turns drift detection into a data problem. See drift

You can also turn all your workflows into a data problem and leverage the datawherhouse eco-system like dbt

### Extensible

CloudQuery is an open-source and extensible framework. All official and approved community providers and policies are listed in [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io). See [Developing New Provider](./developers/developing-new-provider.md).
