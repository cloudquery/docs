# Overview

Provider structs are the main core of the SDK that requires the implementor to create it list all available resources, configuration of it's client and it's config. The provider structs implements the CQProvider Interface allowing the user to just implement his resources and configure function.

## Example

If we look at the example provider definition [in the template](https://github.com/cloudquery/cq-provider-template/blob/main/resources/provider.go):

```go
var (
	//go:embed migrations/*.sql
	providerMigrations embed.FS
)

func Provider() *provider.Provider {
	return &provider.Provider{
		// CHANGEME: Change to your provider name
		Name:      "YourProviderName",
		Configure: client.Configure,
		ResourceMap: map[string]*schema.Table{
			// CHANGEME: Place here all supported resources
			"demo_resource": DemoResource(),
		},
		Migrations: providerMigrations,
		Config: func() provider.Config {
			return &client.Config{}
		},
	}

}
```

Here a new provider struct is defined, which has an empty config, some DB migrations and with just one resource (the "demo_resource").
The `DemoResource()` function would be in its own file, `demo_resource.go`, and would define a whole resource and also contain the fetcher functions/resolvers.
