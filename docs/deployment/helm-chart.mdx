# Helm Chart

The Helm chart deploys a CloudQuery fetch CronJob and everything required to execute it.

The chart source can be found here [github.com/cloudquery/helm-charts](https://github.com/cloudquery/helm-charts).

## Prerequisites

* System configured to access a kubernetes cluster.
* [Helm v3](https://helm.sh) installed and able to access the cluster.
* PostgreSQL database (>11) (e.g. self hosted, via Helm, CloudSQL, RDS, etc.).

Clone the [cloudquery/helm-charts](https://github.com/cloudquery/helm-charts) (all commands in this tutorial will asume
it's downloaded and you are at the root directory).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudquery/helm-charts.git
cd helm-charts
```

## Setting up GKE or EKS

If you don't have a kubernetes cluster already, we provide a few terraform examples that can help you spawn one.
You can use the following terraforms as is, fine-tune them and/or incorporate them into your existing 
infrastructure-as-code.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="eks"
  values={[
    {label: 'EKS', value: 'eks'},
    {label: 'GKE', value: 'gke'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="eks">

  Run the following commands to provision an EKS cluster with managed nodes (**CloudQuery currently is not supported on Fargate nodes**).
  **Please note:** EKS can take 15-25 min to provision, see [aws github issue](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/1227).

```bash
cd terraform/aws
terraform init
cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
# specify required variables in terraform.tfvars
terraform apply
```

  Once the EKS is provisioned run the following commands to authenticate the `kubectl` with the above cluster.

  ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <YOUR_REGION> --name cloudquery
  ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="gke">

  Run the following commands to provision a GKE Cluster.

```bash
cd terraform/gcp
terraform init
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# specify required variables in terraform.tfvars
terraform apply
```
  Once the GKE is provisioned run the following command to authenticate the `kubectl` with the above cluster.

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cloudquery --zone <YOUR_ZONE>
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Installing CloudQuery Helm Chart

First, download Helm dependencies:

```bash
helm dependencies update
```
 
CloudQuery can be configured to run with various dependencies.
The suggested way is to use your own external database (potentially a managed RDS or GCP CloudSQL) but you can 
also spawn a PostgreSQL database together with the helm chart.

#### Installing CloudQuery without PostgreSQL

Following are the minimum steps you need to do before running `helm install`:

* Edit the `config.hcl` file to define what and how you want cloudquery to fetch the information.

In `values.yaml`:
* Update `envRenderSecret:CQ_DSN` to point to your external database.
* Add any additional envirmoent variables under `envRenderSecret` needed for CloudQuery to authenticate with your CloudProvider.
* Update `schedule` with the required schedule you want CloudQuery to run (https://crontab.guru/).

To install just run:

```bash
helm install cloudquery .
```

You will see the following output

```text
cloudquery . 
NAME: cloudquery
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Feb 10 13:59:29 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
1. Welcome! CloudQuery is Installed.
2. To trigger the cronjob manually run:
   kubectl create job --from=cronjob/cloudquery-cron cloudquery-cron
3. To see logs for the job run:
   kubectl logs -f jobs/cloudquery-cron
4. To exec to the admin container with cloudquery binary for debugging purposes run:
   kubectl exec -it deployment/cloudquery-admin -- /bin/sh
```

#### Installing CloudQuery with PostgreSQL

In addition to the steps defined in the previous section you need to do the following before running `helm install cloudquery .`

In `values.yaml`
* Update `postgresql.enabled` to `true`
* Under `postgresql`, update `postgresqlUsername`,  `postgresqlPassword` and `postgresqlDatabase` to your wanted values.

### Uninstalling helm chart

To uninstall, run:

```bash
helm uninstall cloudquery
```
