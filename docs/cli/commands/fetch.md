# fetch

Fetches resources from configured providers.

This requires a config.hcl file which can be generated by `cloudquery init`.

## Usage:
```bash
cloudquery fetch [flags] [filters]

Examples:
  # Fetch configured providers to PostgreSQL as configured in config.hcl
  cloudquery fetch

Flags:
  -d, --disable-delete        disable pre-fetch fetch delete
      --fail-on-error         CloudQuery should return a failure error code if provider has any error
  -h, --help                  help for fetch
      --skip-schema-upgrade   skip schema upgrade of provider fetch, disabling this flag might cause issues
```

## Specifying provider or resource name

Fetch allows specifying certain provider or resources, if multiple providers are configured. The expected format is one argument per provider, optionally followed by a colon (`:`) and list of comma separated resource names.

Examples:

Fetch AWS only, resources as defined in config: `cloudquery fetch aws`

Fetch AWS `ec2.instances` only: `cloudquery fetch aws:ec2.instances`

Fetch GCP and Azure only: `cloudquery fetch gcp azure`

Fetch GCP and AWS `ec2.instances` + `s3.buckets` only: `cloudquery fetch gcp aws:ec2.instances,s3.buckets`

:::tip
It's possible to specify new resources that aren't configured in the config.hcl file.
