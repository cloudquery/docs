# Overview

CloudQuery Policies brings policy-as-code to the CloudQuery ecosystem.

CQ Policies enables users to codify, version and run security, compliance and cost rules, using SQL as the query engine and [HCL as the logical layer](./language).

## Key Features

- **As-Code**: Get all the benefits of using "as-code" such as collaboration, reuse, and version control.
- **CloudQuery Hub**: [Access](https://hub.cloudquery.io) official and community CloudQuery policies that you can use as-is or customize to your needs. Also, share your own policies on GitHub and publish them on CloudQuery Hub to get feedback from the community.

## Getting Started

First you need to make sure you run the [`fetch`](../fetch/overview) command and your database is ingested with all your cloud assets configuration.

[CloudQuery policies](./language) can be stored on GitHub or locally and published on [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io) for easy discovery and documentation.

### Running Policies

The following will run the policy hosted on [github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws](https://github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws) as the default host is GitHub.

```bash
cloudquery policy run github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws
```

Cloudquery will always download the latest tag of the policy if no specific tag/commit/branch is defined, you can set a specific branch using `@` or `?ref=<tag/branch/commit-hash>` to your `source` url. Examples:

```bash
cloudquery policy run github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws@v0.1.0
```

```bash
cloudquery policy run github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws?ref=v0.1.0
```

To run policies from other sources check the following [page](./sources).

#### Running sub-policies

Some policies are built as packs and only specific sub-policies are relevant for us, we can specificy sub-policies with `//` path dominator in our `source` argument.

```bash
cloudquery policy run github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws//cis_v1.2.0
```

You can also run a specific check - for example if we want to run a IAM check in cis_v1.2.0:

```bash
cloudquery policy run github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws//cis_v1.2.0/1/1.9
```

will run the `1.9` check under section 1 policy of cis v1.2.0.


### Policy configuration

To add policies to your `config.hcl` you can simply add `policy` blocks, you can either add inline policies or point to a policy by `source`.

```hcl
# ... CloudQuery and provider blocks here ...
// Policy Configurations
policy "aws-cis" {
  source = "github.com/cloudquery-policies/aws//cis_v1.2.0"
}
```

#### Running local-policies

To run a local policy that uses the [local source](./sources#local) you can set the policy in your `config.hcl` or pass the policy file path when executing `policy run` command as follows:

```bash
cloudquery policy run path\to\policy
```

You can use either a relative path or an absolute path. If you are configuring the local policy in your `config.hcl` it is advised to use relative paths, as absolute paths tend to couple your configuration to the filesystem layout of a particular computer.


### Results

Scan results will show passed/failed queries and manual queries that just print output without a pass/fail predicate.

For every failed resource the following attributes are printed if found (in that order):
- `id`, `identifier`, `resource_idnetifier`, `uid`, `uuid`, `arn`

You can use the `--output-dir /path/to/` option to get the policies results in JSON format.
