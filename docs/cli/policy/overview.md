# Overview

CloudQuery CLI can be used to run policies on CloudQuery tables.

> **CloudQuery policies** - CloudQuery Policies feature brings policy-as-code to the CloudQuery ecosystem. CQ Policies enable users to codify, version and run security, governance, cost and compliance rules, using SQL as the query layer and HCL as the logical layer. Checkout more details in our [blog](https://www.cloudquery.io/blog/announcing-cloudquery-policies).

## Getting Started



### Downloading

First , you need to download a policy.
We can download a policy from the following locations:

1. CloudQuery Hub
2. Any community Git repository

We can use the following commands to download a policy:

`cloudquery policy download <POLICY_TO_DOWNLOAD>`

#### Examples

Download from CloudQuery [Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io):

    cloudquery policy download <HUB_POLICY_NAME>

Download from community GitHub repository:

    cloudquery policy download <COMMUNITY_ORG>/<POLICY_NAME>


Download from any other Git repository:

    cloudquery policy download https://gitlab.com/<COMMUNITY_ORG>/<POLICY_NAME>.git

### Running

There are two ways to run a policy:

1. Using the CLI (Running a single policy)
2. Using CloudQuery config file (Running multiple policies)

#### Running using CLI

To run a single policy, we can use the following command:

Running policy from CloudQuery hub

    cloudquery policy run <HUB_POLICY_NAME>

Running policy from community GitHub repository

    cloudquery policy run <COMMUNITY_ORG>/<POLICY_NAME>

Running policy from any other VSC

    cloudquery policy run https://gitlab.com/<COMMUNITY_ORG>/<POLICY_NAME>.git

Available options:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| --output-dir | Output directory for the policy results |
| --stop-on-failure | Stop execution on first failure |
| --fail-on-violation | Return non zero exit code if one of the policy is violated |
| --skip-versioning | Skip policy versioning and use latest files |
| --no-result | Do not show policies results |
| --sub-path | Forces the policy run command to only execute this sub policy/query |


#### Running using CloudQuery config file

To run a multiple policies, we can use the CloudQuery [config file](configuration.md).

To run all policies in the config file

    cloudquery policy run 

To run single policy from the config file

    cloudquery policy run --policy <POLICY_NAME>

Available options:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| --policy | Name of the policy to run |
| --output-dir | Output directory for the policy results |
| --stop-on-failure | Stop execution on first failure |
| --fail-on-violation | Return non zero exit code if one of the policy is violated |
| --skip-versioning | Skip all policies versioning and use latest files |
| --no-result | Do not show policies results |

### Results
Scan results will look something like this:
