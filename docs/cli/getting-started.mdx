# Getting Started

## Download and Install

You can download the precompiled binary from [releases](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases), or using CLI:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="precompiled"
  values={[
    {label: 'Pre-Compiled Binaries', value: 'precompiled'},
    {label: 'Homebrew', value: 'homebrew'},
    {label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="precompiled">

Download latest version:


```bash
export OS=Darwin # Possible values: Linux, Windows, Darwin
export ARCH=x86_64 # Possible values x86_64, arm64
curl -L https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases/latest/download/cloudquery_${OS}_${ARCH} -o cloudquery
chmod a+x cloudquery
```

Download specific version:

```bash
export OS=Darwin # Possible values: Linux, Windows, Darwin
export ARCH=x86_64 # Possible values x86_64, arm64
export VERSION= # specifiy a version
curl -L https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/releases/download/${VERSION}/cloudquery_${OS}_${ARCH} -o cloudquery
```  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="homebrew">

```bash
brew install cloudquery/tap/cloudquery
# After initial install you can upgrade the version via:
brew upgrade cloudquery
```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="docker">

`config.yml` should be mounted so cloudquery can read it

```
# Dockers are hosted at github container registry https://github.com/orgs/cloudquery/packages/container/package/cloudquery
docker pull ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest
docker run -v /data:/data -it ghcr.io/cloudquery/cloudquery:latest --path /data/config.yml --dsn "host=localhost user=postgres password=pass DB.name=postgres port=5432"
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Running

All official and approved community providers are listed at [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io) with their respective documentation.

### Init Command

The first step is to generate a `config.hcl` file that will describe which cloud provider you want to use and which resources you want CloudQuery to ETL:

```text
cloudquery init aws
# cloudquery init gcp aws # This will generate a config containing gcp and aws providers
# cloudquery init --help # Show all possible auto generated configs and flags
```

### Spawn or Connect to a Database

CloudQuery needs a PostgreSQL database (>11). You can either spawn a local one (usually good for development and local testing)
or connect to an existing one.

For local, you can use the following docker command:

```
docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -d postgres
```

If you are using an existing database, you will have to update the `connection` section 
in config.hcl:

```hcl
cloudquery {
  plugin_directory = "./cq/providers"
  policy_directory = "./cq/policies"

  provider "aws" {
    source  = ""
    version = "latest"
  }

  connection {
    dsn = "host=localhost user=postgres password=pass database=postgres port=5432"
  }
}
```

### Fetch Command

Once `config.hcl` is generated, run the following command to fetch the resources. \(You need to be authenticated â€” see relevant section under each provider\):

```text
cloudquery fetch
# cloudquery fetch --help # Show all possible fetch flags
```

Once your provider has fetched resources, you can run the following example queries.

### Exploring and Running Queries

Schema and tables for each provider are available in [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io)

A few examples for AWS:

#### List ec2\_images:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aws_ec2_images;
```

#### Find all public-facing AWS load balancers:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aws_elbv2_load_balancers WHERE scheme = 'internet-facing';
```

### Policy Command

CloudQuery Policies allow users to write security, governance, cost, and compliance rules, 
using SQL as the query layer and HCL as the logical layer.

All official and approved community policies are listed on [CloudQuery Hub](https://hub.cloudquery.io).

#### Execute a policy

All official policies are hosted at https://github.com/cloudquery-policies.

```bash
cloudquery policy run aws-cis-1.2.0
```
